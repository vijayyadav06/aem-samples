<!--/*
    you will see an odd data-sly-element below, it's intended to fix the authoring overlay as this component
    is only used within the responsive-table component.  When we include it in publish (as all the required data attributes
    are set here, we use data-sly-unwrap.  However, as data-sly-unwrap also changes the overlay, for author we instead make
    the component use a div, and don't unwrap the resource include.  This way the publish and author views work.
